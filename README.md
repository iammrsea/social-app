# This is still under construction  ⚒️ 🚧

### Details and architecture will be coming soon!!!
I'm taking somewhat an unconventional approach to this project. Combining the power of CQRS, DDD, Clean Architecture, and Event-Driven Architecture. This approach allows for a more flexible and scalable architecture, while also providing a robust and reliable system. By leveraging these principles, we can ensure that our application is maintainable, testable, and scalable. Additionally, by using a domain-driven design approach, we can ensure that our application is aligned with the business domain and that our code is easy to understand and maintain. Furthermore, by using a clean architecture approach, we can ensure that our application is modular and easy to test and maintain.


So you are welcome to explore the codebase and drop an issue if you have any questions or suggestions.
